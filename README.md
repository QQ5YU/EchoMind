# EchoMind
EchoMind is an AI-powered desktop application designed to capture, index, and retrieve the value of sound. By combining 'Echo' (precise audio ingestion) with 'Mind' (RAG-based intelligence), it transforms hours of recordings into a structured knowledge base, allowing you to search through audio as easily as text.
