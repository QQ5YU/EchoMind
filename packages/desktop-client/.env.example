# Frontend environment sample for development
# Copy to .env and edit as needed

# Backend API base URL used by the renderer
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: when developing the renderer with Vite, set ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL
# to the dev server address so the main process can load the renderer URL.
# Example (uncomment to use):
# ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Notes:
# - Use http(s) URL that points to your running backend (see packages/backend/.env.sample).
# - Do NOT commit real secrets to the repo.
